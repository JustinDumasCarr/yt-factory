# Generate Suno AI Music

This is the key endpoint in the Suno API. Each request returns exactly 2 songs.

* Stream URL: Available in 30-40 seconds.
* Downloadable song URL: Ready in 2-3 minutes.

Concurrency limit: 20 requests every 10 seconds. Exceeding this will result in request rejection. Please review the parameters carefully to ensure proper use.

### Parameter Usage Guide

* When customMode is true (Custom Mode):
  * If instrumental is true: style and title are required
  * If instrumental is false: style, prompt, and title are required
  * Prompt length limit:
    * For V4 model: 3000 characters
    * For V4\_5, V4\_5PLUS, V4\_5ALL and V5 models: 5000 characters
  * Style length limit:
    * For V4 model: 200 characters
    * For V4\_5, V4\_5PLUS, V4\_5ALL and V5 models: 1000 characters
  * Title length limit:
    * For V4 and V4\_5ALL model: 80 characters
    * For V4\_5, V4\_5PLUS and V5 models: 100 characters
* When customMode is false (Non-custom Mode):
  * Only prompt is required regardless of instrumental setting
  * prompt length limit: 500 characters
  * Other parameters should be left empty

### Developer Notes

1. Recommendation for First-Time Users: Start with customMode: false and instrumental: false, and only provide a prompt. This is the simplest setup to quickly test the API and experience the results.
2. Generated files are retained for 15 days before being deleted
3. Ensure all required fields are provided based on the customMode and instrumental settings to avoid errors
4. Respect the character limits for prompt, style, and title to ensure successful processing
5. Callback process has three stages: text (text generation), first (first track complete), complete (all tracks complete)
6. You can use the Get Music Generation Details endpoint to actively check task status instead of waiting for callbacks

                    A description of the desired audio content.  

                    - In Custom Mode (`customMode: true`): Required if
                    `instrumental` is `false`. The prompt will be strictly used
                    as the lyrics and sung in the generated track. Character
                    limits by model:  
                      - **V4**: Maximum 3000 characters  
                      - **V4_5, V4_5PLUS, V4_5ALL & V5**: Maximum 5000 characters  
                      Example: "A calm and relaxing piano track with soft melodies"  
                    - In Non-custom Mode (`customMode: false`): Always required.
                    The prompt serves as the core idea, and lyrics will be
                    automatically generated based on it (not strictly matching
                    the input). Maximum 500 characters.  
                      Example: "A short relaxing piano tune"

                    The music style or genre for the audio.  

                    - Required in Custom Mode (`customMode: true`). Examples:
                    "Jazz", "Classical", "Electronic". 
                      - For V4 model: Max length: 200 characters. 
                      - For V4_5, V4_5PLUS, V4_5ALL and V5 models: Max length: 1000 characters.

                    limits by model:  
                      - **V4 & V4_5ALL**: Maximum 80 characters  
                      - **V4_5, V4_5PLUS & V5**: Maximum 100 characters  
                      Example: "Peaceful Piano Meditation"  
                    - In Non-custom Mode (`customMode: false`): Leave empty.

                    Enables Custom Mode for advanced audio generation
                    settings.  

                    - Set to `true` to use Custom Mode (requires `style` and
                    `title`; `prompt` required if `instrumental` is `false`).
                    The prompt will be strictly used as lyrics if `instrumental`
                    is `false`.  

                    - Set to `false` for Non-custom Mode (only `prompt` is
                    required). Lyrics will be auto-generated based on the
                    prompt.
                  example: true

                    - In Custom Mode (`customMode: true`):  
                      - If `true`: Only `style` and `title` are required.  
                      - If `false`: `style`, `title`, and `prompt` are required (with `prompt` used as the exact lyrics).  
                    - In Non-custom Mode (`customMode: false`): No impact on
                    required fields (`prompt` only). Lyrics are auto-generated
                    if `instrumental` is `false`.
